Entire Game on One Screen

Reminds me of This Is The Only Room

Roguelike dungeon where maps can cover the entire screen including inventory status and even other maps

Pachinko
PAchinko that rearranges itself??!??!??

No, none of this.
A puzzle game! Yeah!

There are a set of rooms, with a bunch of mice in them.
Your objective is to get all of the mice to go, one in each room.

You have a couple of tools at your disposal.
Rooms are connected by corridors. Some corridors have doors.
It is possible to shut and open doors.

You can also control mice.
You can SCARE them, which causes all mice in the room to retreat to the farthest accessible room.
You can SNARE them, which causes all mice which can access the current room to arrive.
You can SPLIT them, which causes mige to evenly* split into accessible rooms.
	* n mice, R rooms, (n/R go in each room, n%R stay in the original room)
	* 7 mice, 2 rooms, 3 go to each room, one stays in the original room, so 3 and 4
	* okay

Will this be fun? Who can say.
